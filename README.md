# moso_bamboo_resequencing

The pipelines and scripts used in moso bamboo sequencing, including 5 parts as followed:

## 1. SNP & Indel detection using GATK

## 2. Structural variation detection using Breakdancer, Manta, and SUVOVOR

## 3. Copy number variation detection using Control-FREEC

## 4. Analysis of genome-wide heterozygous genotypes

## 5. Detection of natural selection, including positive seletion using SweeD and DAF, and balance selection using BalLeRMix

Note: The scripts used in moso bamboo are well tested, but we donnot commit it to be suitable for all different project.
